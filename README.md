# mterczynski-tslint

My own TSLint config that I use for my personal projects.

## Installation + configuration

```bash
# Install mterczynski-tslint as dev dependency
npm i -D mterczynski-tslint
```

Update `"extends"` field in your tslint.json:

```json
{
    "extends": [
        "mterczynski-tslint"
    ]
}
```
